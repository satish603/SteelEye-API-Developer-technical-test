# Schema model
I have been provided a Pydantic model representing a single Trade below:

import datetime as dt

from typing import Optional
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class TradeDetails(BaseModel):
    buySellIndicator: str = Field(description="A value of BUY for buys, SELL for sells.")

    price: float = Field(description="The price of the Trade.")

    quantity: int = Field(description="The amount of units traded.")


class Trade(BaseModel):
